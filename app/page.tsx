        <p className="mb-4">
          My name is Hemanta Sundaray. I&apos;m 37 years old, a husband, and a
          dad to a 2-year-old son. I live in Odisha, a state in the eastern part
          of India.

          For more than a decade, I worked in the fashion industry across
          various functions such as design, product merchandising, buying, and
          retail operations. However, in June 2022, I decided to quit and pursue
          programming. Since then, I have been freelancing as a technical writer
          for an edtech platform and building side projects, mostly AI wrappers.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Yes, I&apos;m a fullstack developer with a focus on modern web
          technologies. My primary tech stack includes TypeScript, React (via
          Next.js), Firebase, Supabase, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. I also have
          extensive experience working with various AWS services such as
          Fargate, Lambda, S3, SES, and SQS.

          What experience do you have using AI tools to automate tasks and
          workflows? Can you provide examples of how you&apos;ve done this
          successfully?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I have extensive experience using AI tools to automate tasks and
          streamline workflows, particularly in the areas of coding, research,
          and writing. When ChatGPT was first launched, I had just started
          working as a freelance technical writer for an edtech platform. I
          quickly recognized the potential of AI to improve my productivity, so
          I began using ChatGPT to assist with research and drafting blog posts.
          While other writers were outputting 2-3 1500-word posts per month, I
          was writing 10. I had increased my productivity by 5 times.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Over the course of several months, from December 2022 to July 2023, I
          deepened my expertise with ChatGPT, initially using the 3.5 model and
          later upgrading to GPT-4. Through hands-on experience, I developed a
          strong understanding of how to write effective prompts to get the best
          responses from the AI. I learned to work around its limitations and
          play to its strengths, which enabled me to consistently leverage the
          tool to produce high-quality work.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As my freelance projects slowed down, I joined the AI bandwagon and
          started building personal projects, primarily AI wrappers. Once again,
          I relied on ChatGPT to support me with coding and troubleshooting.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When Anthropic launched Claude, I was impressed by its writing
          capabilities and its willingness to follow instructions. I now use
          Claude 3 Opus extensively for coding, research and writing tasks,
          turning to GPT-4 as a complementary tool when Claude is unable to
          help.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In addition to ChatGPT and Claude, I&apos;ve also explored Gemini Pro,
          but found that it didn&apos;t consistently deliver the same level of
          quality and insight.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout my journey with AI tools, I&apos;ve learned to quickly
          assess the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. While I have my
          go-to favourites in ChatGPT and Claude, I&apos;m confident in my
          ability to rapidly get up to speed on any AI tools that would be
          helpful in supporting your needs as an assistant.

        <h2>Does that have a good crossover with UK time?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          India Standard Time (IST) is 4 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the UK.
          Let&apos;s consider a typical UK workday of 8 hours from 10 AM to 7
          PM, with a one-hour lunch break. Here&apos;s how that translates to my
          time zone:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 leading-7 text-neutral-700">
          <li>When it&apos;s 10 AM in the UK, it&apos;s 2:30 PM for me.</li>
          <li>Your 7 PM end of day is 11:30 PM my time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So for the majority of your workday,I&apos;m awake and available.
          I&apos;m confident that my location won&apos;t be an obstacle, and
          I&apos;m committed to being responsive and accessible during the core
          hours that matter most for your workflow.
